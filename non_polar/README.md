# Non polar Simulation (non_polar)

This project is a **modern migration of an old Java applet** that
demonstrates the concept of the **non polar bond (unpolare Bindung)**
in chemistry.  

The original Java applet (written in 2007) used `AppletViewer` and
`MouseListener`.  
This version is fully functional in modern web browsers
using **HTML5 and JavaScript**.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of non polar bonds  
- Randomized visual elements to illustrate bond behavior  
- Mouse click events trigger updates in the simulation  
- Fully client-side — no Java required  

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the concept of non polar chemical bonds using
an interactive simulation.
The simulation shows a molecule containing two hydrogen atoms
and visualizes how electrons are more likely to be found in the middle of
the molecule.
It is intended as a didactical tool for chemistry students to intuitively understand electron distribution in molecules.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
2. Click anywhere on the canvas to interact with the simulation  
3. Observe the asymmetical electron density and the formation of the intermolecular interaction
