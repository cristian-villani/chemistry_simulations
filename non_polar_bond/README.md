# Non polar Bond Simulation (non_polar_bond)

This project is a **modern migration of an old Java applet** that
demonstrates the concept of the **Non polar bond (Unpolare Bindung)**
in chemistry.  

The original Java applet (written in 2007) used `AppletViewer` and
`MouseListener`.  
This version is fully functional in modern web browsers
using **HTML5 and JavaScript**.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of non polar bonds  
- Randomized visual elements to illustrate bond behavior  
- Mouse click events trigger updates in the simulation  
- Fully client-side — no Java required  

## Purpose

This simulation illustrates the concept of a non polar bond:

- Red dots represent electrons  
- Their movement demonstrates electron distribution in a non polar bond  
- Intended as a didactic tool for students learning chemistry

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
2. Click anywhere on the canvas to interact with the simulation  
3. Observe changes in the position of the red dots, representing the concept
