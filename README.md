# Chemistry Simulations

This repository contains a collection of **educational chemistry simulations**, designed for students to visualize and interact with chemical concepts.

## Simulations included

- [Polar Bond Simulation](polar_bond/) – Illustrates polar bonds in molecules
- [Dipole Simulation](dipole/) – Illustrates dipole molecules interaction
- [Non Polar Bond Simulation](non_polar_bond/) – Illustrates non polar bonds in molecules
- (Future simulations will be added here)

Each simulation is contained in its own folder with a **README.md**
and **LICENSE**.
